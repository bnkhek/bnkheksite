Especially\r\n          since I wanted to build the site using React.js instead of traditional\r\n          HTML/JS, things were somewhat complicated. I also experimented with\r\n          changing the domain name, using temporary free domains to verify that\r\n          I could get it to work, ultimately so that I could buy a domain in my\r\n          name and use it for this site once it's done.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p className=\"contentDetail\">\r\n          After getting it up and running, the next big task was getting various\r\n          subdirectories working. I ended up using React Hash Router for this\r\n          since for some reason I couldn't get React Router to work, thus you\r\n          see the # in the URL. But after accomplishing this, I was all set. All\r\n          that is left is to make the rest of the site good looking and\r\n          informational, and this is where things start falling into place! The\r\n          only thing I didn't do was make a UI/UX wireframe of the site... I'm\r\n          developing this on a day by day basis.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </body>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\r\nimport \"./index.css\";\r\nimport App from \"./App\";\r\nimport About from \"./About\";\r\nimport Routes from \".\";\r\n//import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';\r\nimport { HashRouter, Route, Link, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\n/*ReactDOM.render(\r\n  <React.StrictMode>\r\n    <App />\r\n  </React.StrictMode>,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n*/\r\n\r\nexport default () => (\r\n  <HashRouter>\r\n    <Switch>\r\n      <Route exact path=\"/\" component={App} />\r\n      <Route exact path=\"/About\" component={About} />\r\n    </Switch>\r\n  </HashRouter>\r\n);\r\n\r\n// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change\r\n// unregister() to register() below.
